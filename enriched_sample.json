Most teams start with one compliance domain (e.g., AML monitoring) before expanding to additional frameworks."

        "question": "Does this replace our compliance team?",
        "answer": "No—OpenClaw handles the time-consuming data gathering, aggregation, and initial report assembly, but your compliance officers remain essential for reviewing findings, applying judgment to edge cases, and signing off on reports. Think of it as a tireless analyst that eliminates the tedious data work so your team can focus on risk assessment, policy decisions, and strategic compliance management."

      {
        "question": "How does it adapt to regulatory changes?",
        "answer": "When regulations change (new thresholds, reporting requirements, data fields), you update the rule configuration in OpenClaw's admin panel. The agent immediately applies new rules to all incoming data going forward. We provide a compliance rule template library that's updated quarterly with common regulatory frameworks (SOX, Basel III, GDPR, CCPA, etc.). For custom rules, your team can modify thresholds and logic without coding."
